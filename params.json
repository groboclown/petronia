With easy key strokes, you can move a window\r\nbetween different tiles.\r\n\r\nYou can setup your keys however you like.  You can have a keystroke to\r\nenter a window movement mode, or use hotkeys.\r\n\r\nYou can also prevent Windows from using the <kbd>&#x2756; Win</kbd> key and\r\nuse it for whatever you like.\r\n\r\n#### Strip off Useless Borders to See More of What's Important\r\n\r\nWith a tile layout, and the availability of keys to perform the same actions,\r\nthe title bar and resize borders are useless wastes of space.  Remove them and\r\nsee more of what's actually important.\r\n\r\n![Windows 8.1 Chrome](../master/docs/imgs/intellij-chrome-win8.1.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n*Windows 8.1 - Look at all that wasted screen space*\r\n\r\n![Without Chrome](../master/docs/imgs/intellij-dechromed.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n*Windows 8.1 stripped of all the chrome - Oh mi gorsh I can see so much more of my work!*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Current State of the Software\r\n\r\nThis program is very Alpha.  You run the program in a command shell,\r\nwhich stays open and spews out logging information.  You configure the\r\nsoftware by writing Python code that sets up the configuration.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this was written against 64-bit Windows 8.1.  I'm not sure if\r\nit will work with other versions.  The Windows interfacing code has an\r\nabstraction layer for working with different bit-ness and different versions,\r\nbut those haven't been widely tested.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Running\r\n\r\nYou'll need to ensure you're running Python 3.5 or higher.  This has been\r\ntested on the python.org release version 3.5.2.  You'll need to install the\r\nproper version of Python for your system.  If you're running a 64-bit OS,\r\nthen use the 64-bit Python.  If you are running a 32-bit OS, then use the\r\n32-bit Python.\r\n\r\nThen, download the source.  You'll need to configure the setup for your\r\ncomputer; the example is `user_test_config.py`.  You can name the file\r\nwhatever you want, but it should live in the `manager/src` directory.\r\n\r\nOnce you have your configuration setup, you just run in a cmd prompt:\r\n\r\n```cmd\r\n> set Path=(python 3.5.2 directory);%Path%\r\n> cd (petronia dir)\\manager\\src\r\n> python -u -m petronia.cmd my_config_file.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nPress <kbd>&crarr; Enter</kbd> in the command window to stop the program.\r\n\r\n*So bleeding edge!*\r\n\r\nSee the [Getting Started Guide](docs/user-getting-started.md) for details\r\non how to run and setup your Petronia environment.",
