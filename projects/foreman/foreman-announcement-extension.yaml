about: Defines the extension load complete announcement.
description: >
  Describes the event sent by an extension when it completes loading.  All non-boot extensions
  must send this event in order to tell Foreman that the extension has completed initial
  startup.

  Because this is part of every extension, it is allowed to be sent by every extension, without
  needing to be defined in the list of dependencies.

  extension-startup-complete:
    description: >
      Report by a loaded extension when it has completed all of its startup phase.  Usually,
      this is just before the extension begins the read-events loop.

      The source ID of the event must be the loaded extension name, followed by a colon (':'),
      and some other text afterwards.
