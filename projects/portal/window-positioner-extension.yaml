about: Extensions that handle the positioning of the windows.
description: >
  A standard API for extensions that manage the positioning of windows.  This provides
  a layer of indirection between the native UI windowing events and the extension that
  interprets those and puts the windows where they should belong.  It adds additional
  information to the windows, such as virtual desktop positioning to allow for multiple
  virtual desktops.
