# Base Petronia

The base Petronia design attempts to keep the core engine as small as possible.  The engine provides only the minimal events to run the engine.

## Events


### Event `petronia.bus.event-registry/listener-add`

* Event Id: **`petronia.bus.event-registry/listener-add`**
* Event Class: **`petronia.base.internal_.bus_events.EventListenerAddedEvent`**
* Queue Priority: **normal**
* Only instance triggering permitted
* Public listening allowed

Information about the added event listener.


There is no event triggered for removing an event listener.

### Event `petronia.bus.event-registry/register-event`

* Event Id: **`petronia.bus.event-registry/register-event`**

* Event Class: **`petronia.base.internal_.dispose_events.DisposeCompleteEvent`**

* Public listening allowed

Notification that a dispose completed.

### Event `petronia.participant/request-dispose`

* Event Id: **`petronia.participant/request-dispose`**
* Event Class: **`petronia.base.internal_.dispose_events.RequestDisposeEvent`**
* Queue Priority: **normal**
* Public triggering allowed
* Public listening allowed

Request for a participant to dispose itself.

### Event `petronia.registrar/component-created`

* Event Id: **`petronia.registrar/component-created`**
* Event Class: **`petronia.base.events.component_events.ComponentCreatedEvent`**
* Queue Priority: **normal**
* Public triggering allowed
* Public listening allowed

Reports that a component was created.

### Event `petronia.registrar/component-create-failed`

* Event Id: **`petronia.registrar/component-create-failed`**
* Event Class: **`petronia.base.events.component_events.ComponentCreationFailedEvent`**
* Queue Priority: **normal**
* Public triggering allowed
* Public listening allowed

Reports that a component creation attempt failed.

### Event `petronia.registrar/request-new-component`

* Event Id: **`petronia.registrar/request-new-component`**
* Event Class: **`petronia.base.events.component_events.RequestNewComponentEvent`**
* Queue Priority: **normal**
* Public triggering allowed
* Public listening allowed

Asks the component factory to create a new instance.  The target of theevent is the component factory, which will be called with the request_idto allow the called-back target to know which component was created.

### Event `petronia.system/started`

* Event Id: **`petronia.system/started`**
* Event Class: **`petronia.base.events.system_events.SystemStartedEvent`**
* Queue Priority: **normal**
* Only instance triggering permitted
* Public listening allowed

Event to indicate that all the basic systems at boot time have finishedrunning, and the system is now safe for end user actions.

### Event `petronia.system/halt`

* Event Id: **`petronia.system/halt`**
* Event Class: **`petronia.base.events.system_events.SystemHaltedEvent`**
* Queue Priority: **normal**
* Only instance triggering permitted
* Public listening allowed

Stop the system immediately.

### Event `petronia.system/error`

* Event Id: **`petronia.system/error`**
* Event Class: **`petronia.base.events.system_events.ErrorEvent`**
* Queue Priority: **high**
* Public triggering allowed

Petronia or a loaded extension encountered an error.  This can be generated byanything.


This allows for localization of an error message, and to broadcast the issue to
different extensions that may have custom ways to handle the message.
