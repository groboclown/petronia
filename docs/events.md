# Petronia Events

Events, being the heart of Petronia, require specific details about how they work.

## Guidelines

Any activity that requires one participant of the system to interact with another requires the communication to be done through events.

The nature of events requires them to only exist when they have a specific participant identity that is the target of the event.  In most cases, this corresponds to the intended receiver of the event.  In a few cases, it indicates a participant that had an action act upon it, but may not receive the event.
