
"""
Generic bindings of functions that are common helpers for
Petronia actions.

Some ideas:
    * Monitor window "flash".  When the bound key is pressed, then
        focus on the last "flash" window.
    * Report the window information of the currently focused window.
    * Binding explorer.  A pop-up entry box that allows end user
        to type in text, and the explorer will find matches to the
        bound keys.  It will display the information about the
        binding, including what the key bind is.
    * Dynamic extension loader.
    * Display loaded extensions.
    * Display current state of something.
    * Explore / edit configuration states.
