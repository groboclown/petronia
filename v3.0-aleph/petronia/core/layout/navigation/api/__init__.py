Event API for navigating between tiles.

Navigation uses the 8 compass directions (N, E, S, W, NE, SE, SW, NW) for
relative positions between tile locations.

Implementations must listen to virtual workspace changes and tile layout
changes in order to understand the relative directions between tiles.
